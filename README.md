Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

Project 1: Number Guessing Game.
"Developed a number guessing game using Python that incorporates voice commands for interaction. 
Users can speak commands like 'higher,' 'lower,' or 'guess' to navigate the game. 
Implemented speech recognition and synthesis modules to enable seamless voice-based gameplay. 
Designed with an intuitive interface for an engaging and accessible gaming experience."

Project 2: My own Assistant
"My Own Assistant" is a Python-based project designed to create a system that responds to voice commands.
Utilizing speech recognition libraries and natural language processing, the assistant can perform tasks like setting reminders, searching the web, and controlling system functions. 
Its user-friendly interface and customizable features make it a versatile tool for enhancing productivity and convenience."


Project 3: Android Application
"Last semester, I developed a basic Android application for my college project using Giraffe version Android Studio. 
The app focused on simplifying college tasks such as accessing timetables, grades, and campus news. 
It provided a user-friendly interface and integrated smoothly with existing college systems, enhancing overall efficiency and convenience for students."


Project 4: Mini project on ATM
"Project is a basic ATM simulator developed using Python programming and conditional statements. 
It allows users to perform essential banking functions such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking their account balance. 
The program uses conditional statements to validate user inputs and execute the corresponding actions, providing a simple yet functional ATM experience."
